Tasks remaining


If you click any move link now, the board should immediately update to show what the game looked like at that time. You may also want to update handleClick to be aware of stepNumber when reading the current board state so that you can go back in time then click in the board to create a new entry. (Hint: It's easiest to .slice() off the extra elements from history at the very top of handleClick.)

Wrapping Up
Now, you've made a tic-tac-toe game that:

lets you play tic-tac-toe,
indicates when one player has won the game,
stores the history of moves during the game,
allows players to jump back in time to see older versions of the game board.
Nice work! We hope you now feel like you have a decent grasp on how React works.

If you have extra time or want to practice your new skills, here are some ideas for improvements you could make, listed in order of increasing difficulty:

Display the move locations in the format "(1, 3)" instead of "6".
Bold the currently-selected item in the move list.
Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
